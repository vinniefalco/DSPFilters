="A Collection of Useful C++ Classes for Digital Signal Processing"=
_By Vincent Falco_

_"Techniques for digital signal processing are well guarded and held
close to the chest, as they have valuable applications for multimedia
content. The black art of Infinite Impulse Response ("IIR") filtering
has remained shrouded in secrecy with little publicly available source
code....until now."_

----
Building on the work of cherished luminaries such as Sophocles Orfanidis, Andreas Antoniou, Martin Holters, and Udo Zolzer, this library harnesses the power of C++ templates to solve a useful problem in digital signal processing: the realization of multichannel IIR filters of arbitrary order and prescribed specifications with various properties such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, and Optimum-L (Legendre) responses. The library is provided under the MIT license and is therefore fully compatible with proprietary usage.

Classes are designed as independent re-usable building blocks. Use some or all of the provided features, or extend the functionality by writing your own objects that plug into the robust framework. Only the code that you need will get linked into your application. Here's a list of features:

	* Exclusive focus on IIR filters instead of boring FIR filters
	* Complete implementation of all "RBJ Biquad" Cookbook filter formulas
	* Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, Bessel, Legendre designs
	* Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop transformations
	* Low, High, and Band Shelf filter implementations for most types
	* Smooth interpolation of filter settings, pole/zeros, and biquad coefficients to achieve seamless parameter changes
	* Representation of digital filters using poles and zeros
	* Realization using Direct Form I, Direct Form II, or user provided class
	* Fully factored to minimize template instantiations
	* "Design" layer provides runtime introspection into a filter
	* Utility template functions for manipulating buffers of sample data
	* No calls to malloc or new, great for embedded systems
	* No external dependencies, just the standard C++ library!

Using these filters is easy:

{{{
    // Create a Chebyshev type I Band Stop filter of order 3
    // with state for processing 2 channels of audio.
    Dsp::SimpleFilter <Dsp::ChebyshevI::BandStop <3>, 2> f;
    f.setup (3,    // order
             44100,// sample rate
             4000, // center frequency
             880,  // band width
             1);   // ripple dB
    f.process (numSamples, arrayOfChannels);
}}}

An accompanying demonstration program that works on most popular platforms by using the separately licensed Juce application framework (included), exercises all the functionality of the library, including these features:

	* Dynamic interface creates itself using filter introspection capabilities
	* Audio playback with real time application of a selected filter
	* Live time stretching and amplitude modulation without clicks or popping
	* Charts to show magnitude, phase response and pole/zero placement
	* Thread safety "best practices" for audio applications

DOCUMENTATION

All symbols are in the Dsp namespace.

class Filter

  This is an abstract polymorphic interface that supports any filter. The
  parameters to the filter are passed in the Params structure, which is
  essentially an array of floating point numbers with a hard coded size
  limit (maxParameters). Each filter makes use of the Params as it sees fit.

  Filter::getKind ()
  Filter::getName ()
  Filter::getNumParams ()
  Filter::getParamInfo ()

  Through the use of these functions, the caller can determine the meaning
  of each indexed filter parameter at run-time. The ParamInfo structure
  contains methods that describe information about an individual parameter,
  including convenience functions to map a filter parameter to a "control
  value" in the range 0...1, suitable for presentation by a GUI element such
  as a knob or scrollbar.

  Filter::getDefaultParams ()
  Filter::getParams ()
  Filter::getParam ()
  Filter::setParam ()
  Filter::findParamId ()
  Filter::setParamById ()
  Filter::setParams ()
  Filter::copyParamsFrom ()

  These methods allow the caller to inspect the values of the parameters,
  and set the filter parameters in various ways. When parameters are changed
  they take effect on the filter immediately.

  Filter::getPoleZeros ()
  Filter::response ()

  For analysis, these routines provide insight into the pole/zero arrangement
  in the z-plane, and the complex valued response at a given normalized
  frequency in the range (0..nyquist = 0.5]. From the complex number the
  magnitude and phase can be calculated.

  Filter::getNumChannels()
  Filter::reset()
  Filter::process()

  These functions are for applying the filter to channels of data. If the
  filter was not created with channel state (i.e. Channels==0 in the derived
  class template) then they will throw an exception.

  To create a Filter object, use operator new on a subclass template with
  appropriate parameters based on the type of filter you want. Here are the
  subclasses.



template <class DesignClass, int Channels = 0, class StateType = DirectFormII>
class FilterDesign : public Filter

  This subclass of Filter takes a DesignClass (explained below) representing
  a filter, an optional parameter for the number of channels of data to
  process, and an optional customizable choice of which state realization
  to use for processing samples. Channels may be zero, in which case the
  object can only be used for analysis.

  Because the DesignClass is a member and not inherited, it is in general
  not possible to call members of the DesignClass directly. You must go
  through the Filter interface.



template <class DesignClass, int Channels, class StateType = DirectFormII>
class SmoothedFilterDesign : public Filter

  This subclass of FilterDesign implements a filter of the given DesignClass,
  and also performs smoothing of parameters over time. Specifically, when
  one or more filter parameters (such as cutoff frequency) are changed, the
  class creates a transition over a given number of samples from the original
  values to the new values. This process is invisible and seamless to the
  caller, except that the constructor takes an additional parameter that
  indicates the duration of transitions when parameters change.



template <class FilterClass, int Channels = 0, class StateType = DirectFormII>
class SimpleFilter : public FilterClass

  This is a simple wrapper around a given raw FilterClass (explained below).
  It uses inheritance so all of the members of the FilterClass are available
  to instances of this object. The simple wrapper provides state information
  for processing channels in the given form.

  The wrapper does not support introspection, parameter smoothing, or the
  Params style of applying filter settings. Instead, it uses the interface
  of the given FilterClass, which is typically a function called setup()
  that takes a list of arguments representing the parameters.

  The use of this class bypasses the virtual function overhead of going
  through a Filter object. It is not practical to change filter parameters
  of a SimpleFilter, unless you are re-using the filter for a brand new
  stream of data in which case reset() should be called immediately before
  or after changing parameters, to clear the state and prevent audible
  artifacts.



Filter family namespaces

  Each family of filters is given its own namespace. Currently these namespaces
  include:

  RBJ:          Filters from the RBJ Cookbook
  Butterworth:  Filters with Butterworth response
  ChebyshevI:   Filters using Chebyshev polynomials (ripple in the passband)
  ChebyshevII:  "Inverse Chebyshev" filters (ripple in the stopband)
  Elliptic:     Filters with ripple in both the passband and stopband
  Bessel:       Uses Bessel polynomials, theoretically with linear phase
  Legendre:     "Optimum-L" filters with steepest transition and monotonic passband.
  Custom:       Simple filters that allow poles and zeros to be specified directly

<class FilterClass>

  Within each namespace we have a set of "raw filters" (each one is an example
  of a FilterClass). For example, the raw filters in the Butterworth namespace are:

  Butterworth::LowPass
  Butterworth::HighPass
  Butterworth::BandPass
  Butterworth::BandStop
  Butterworth::LowShelf
  Butterworth::HighShelf
  Butterworth::BandShelf

  When a class template (such as SimpleFilter) requires a FilterClass, it is
  expecting an identifier of a raw filter. For example, Legendre::LowPass. The
  raw filters do not have any support for introspection or the Params style of
  changing filter settings. All they offer is a setup() function for updating
  the IIR coefficients to a given set of parameters.

<class DesignClass>

  Each filter family namespace also has the nested namespace "Design". Inside
  this namespace we have all of the raw filter names repeated, except that
  these classes additional provide the Design interface, which adds
  introspection, polymorphism, the Params style of changing filter settings,
  and in general all of the features necessary to interoperate with the Filter
  virtual base class and its derived classes. For example, the design filters
  from the Butterworth namespace are:

  Butterworth::Design::LowPass
  Butterworth::Design::HighPass
  Butterworth::Design::BandPass
  Butterworth::Design::BandStop
  Butterworth::Design::LowShelf
  Butterworth::Design::HighShelf
  Butterworth::Design::BandShelf

  For any class template that expects a DesignClass, you must pass a suitable
  object from the Design namespace of the desired filter family. For example,
  ChebyshevI::Design::BandPass.
